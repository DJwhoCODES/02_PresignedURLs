# ORM

1. Object Relational Mapping (ORM) - It is for SQL Databases
2. It is a technique used in creating a "bridge" between object-oriented programs and relational-databases
3. sequelize orm
4. "mysql2": It is a driver that helps connection between the application and the database. It supports both callbacks and Promises

ðŸ”¹ What is mysql2 driver?

- A low-level Node.js library used to connect to a MySQL database and run SQL queries directly.
- It acts as a driver between your Node.js app and MySQL.
- You write SQL manually

ðŸ”¹ What is Sequelize ORM?

- A high-level ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for Node.js that abstracts away SQL.
- Works on top of drivers like mysql2, pg, etc.
- No need to write raw SQL â€” Sequelize converts JavaScript operations into SQL automatically.

ðŸŽ¯ Summary:

- Use mysql2 if you want full control, performance, and donâ€™t mind writing SQL manually.
- Use Sequelize if you prefer a model-based, SQL-free development experience with added features like migrations and associations.
